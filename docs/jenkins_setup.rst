Jenkins Setup (Docker Container)
================================
After doing some additional reading, it seems to make more sense to install Jenkins in a container. This way, it will
be portable and by committing any changes to a custom image, I won't need to redo any specific plugins or
customizations as they will all be there in the container.

We'll install the `the containerized Docker version <https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/>`_ on Docker Hub and
go with the documentation linked there.

First, we'll run the Jenkins in non-detached mode to make sure everything is working.

.. code:: bash

   docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --name Jenkins_Master -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts

Configuring Jenkins
-------------------
Now you can check out the running instance in your browser at **localhost:8080**

The first time, you'll be presented with a setup window which will prompt you for a password.

.. image:: images/jenkins_unlock.png
   :align: center

As indicated in the dialog, you can either find the initial password in the official Jenkins log file at
**/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log** or at the location mentioned in the dialog -
**/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword**.

Next you'll be prompted to install plugins. I selected the **Install Suggested Plugins** option. Next you'll be
prompted to create the first admin account. Finally, you'll be at the main Jenkins page.

Blue Ocean Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Of course, this option didn't install the **BlueOcean plugin** so we need to do this next. Details for this are
pulled from the Jenkins.io `Getting Started with Blue Ocean <https://jenkins.io/doc/book/blueocean/getting-started/>`_
page.

To install the Blue Ocean suite of plugins to your Jenkins instance:

* If required, ensure you are logged in to Jenkins (as a user with the Admin permission).
* From the Jenkins home page (i.e. the Dashboard of the Jenkins classic UI), click **Manage Jenkins** on
  the left and then Manage Plugins in the center.
* Click the Available tab and type blue ocean into the Filter text box, which filters the list of plugins
  to those whose name and/or description contains the words **"blue"** and **"ocean"**.

Select the Blue Ocean pluginâ€™s check box near the top of the the Install column and then click either the
Download now and install after restart button (recommended) or the Install without restart button at the the end of
the page.

.. Note::

   There is no need to select the check boxes of the other plugins in this filtered list because the main Blue
   Ocean plugin has other plugin dependencies (constituting the Blue Ocean suite of plugins) which will automatically
   be selected and installed when you click one of these "Install" buttons.

   If you chose the Install without restart button, you may need to restart Jenkins in order to gain full Blue Ocean
   functionality.

Configure to Run in Docker-Compose
----------------------------------
Once the setup has been confirmed, we need to add the setup to our docker-compose.yaml file. Here are the updates

.. code:: bash

      jenkins:
        image: jenkins/jenkins:lts
        ports:
          - "50000:5000"
          - "8080:8080"
        volumes:
          - jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home
        container_name: Jenkins_Master

That should do it.
