Mail Server Setup
===============================
To confirm proper email generation from all the various pipeline tools, it make sense
to set up a local mail server so we can have local email addresses to use. For this we'll use `Mailu
<https://mailu.io/>`_ which is a dockerized version of the free `Postfix mail server
<http://www.postfix.org/>`_. The image we'll be working from is `mailu/postfix image
<https://hub.docker.com/r/mailu/postfix/>`_ from Docker Hub.
