Ubuntu Environment
==================
We'll be setting up a Security DevOps (SecOps) sandbox server to experiment with various DevOps
tools and approaches.

I've installed a dual boot version of Ubuntu 17.10 along side Windows 10 on a new desktop server.
Credential details are in a LastPass secure note titled **Dell SecOps Desktop Server**. Additional
details:

* Server Name: Wakanda
* Server IP: 192.168.1.2
