Gerrit Setup
============

I initially tried to run Gerrit in a docker container, but hit two issues:

1) The number of containers I was running was eating up too much RAM

2) I couldn't figure out how to persist Gerrit data across container restarts

So I'm going old school and installing Gerrit on bare metal

The details I'm following are `here <https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/install-quick.html>`_
